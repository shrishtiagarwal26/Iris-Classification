# Iris-Classification

## Overview
This is a simple classification task performed on the Iris dataset - one of the best known dataset in the world of data science.

## Motivation
I am definitely not a flower expert, but with the help of a dataset with 150 iris instances with their petal/sepal measurements, can I be one? Also which of the petal/sepal measurements are more useful to look at?

## Procedure
* Import Libraries and Load Dataset
* Numerical Summary
* Train-Test Split
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Development

## Models
* Classification Tree
* Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (linear kernel and polynomial kernel)
